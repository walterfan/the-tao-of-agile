# Sprint Plan Meeting

## Input
Product backlog is prepared in advance by the Product Owner.

If necessary, a Backlog Brainstorm meeting can be held first.

## Process
Sprint Planning.

Sprint Planning starts a Sprint by arranging the work to be done in the Sprint.

The final plan is created collaboratively by the entire Scrum Team.

The Product Owner must ensure that the participants are ready to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.

### 1. Why is this Sprint valuable?

The Product Owner proposes how the product can increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. Then, the entire Scrum Team will jointly develop a Sprint Goal to communicate the reasons why the current Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the end of Sprint Planning.

### 2. What can be completed (Done) in this Sprint?

By discussing with the Product Owner, the development team selects some items from the Product Backlog and puts them into the current Sprint. The Scrum Team can refine these Product Backlog items during this process to increase understanding and confidence. Selecting how much work can be completed in the Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the development team knows about their past performance, their productivity in the upcoming Sprint, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint predictions.

### 3. How to complete the selected work?
For each selected Product Backlog item, the development team plans the necessary work to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is usually done by decomposing Product Backlog items (features) into smaller items (user stories) that take one day or less. The development team decides on their own how to complete this work. No one tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into value-creating Increments.

## Output
Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog. The selected Product Backlog items for this Sprint plus the plan for how to deliver them are called the Sprint Backlog.
